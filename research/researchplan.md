# The Great Decoupling: Deep Research Plan (Pre–Claim Ledger)

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **deep research phase** for *The Great Decoupling* project.

The goal of this phase is **not** to argue, persuade, or synthesize.  
The goal is to **collect, bound, and validate raw evidence** such that a claim ledger can later be constructed without structural weakness.

No narrative writing, moral framing, or causal certainty is permitted during this phase.

---

## Guiding Principle

> Evidence first. Interpretation later.  
> Description before causation.  
> Structure before story.

---

## Research Architecture Overview

The deep research phase consists of **three independent research runs**.  
Each run is a self-contained body of evidence that can stand alone.

The runs are intentionally orthogonal. Failure or revision in one run must not invalidate the others.

### The Three Runs

1. **R1 – Productivity and Compensation**
2. **R2 – Household Costs and Viability**
3. **R3 – Distribution and Surplus Capture**

Each run will be executed in a separate research workspace.

---

## Global Rules (Apply to All Runs)

- No conclusions sections
- No narrative language
- No moral framing
- No claims of intent or design
- All definitions must be explicit
- Time ranges must be stated
- Measurement choices must be recorded
- Disagreements between sources must be preserved, not resolved
- Uncertainty must be documented, not smoothed over

If synthesis pressure appears, stop and document it as a risk.

## RUN 1: Productivity and Compensation

### Core Research Question

> What exactly decoupled from what, when, and under which definitions?

This run establishes whether the productivity–compensation split exists, how sensitive it is to definitions, and where its boundaries lie.

---

### Subquestions

- How is productivity defined across major datasets?
- How is worker compensation defined?
- What happens when benefits are included or excluded?
- How does median vs mean compensation change conclusions?
- How do different inflation adjustments affect results?
- Is 1973 the most defensible breakpoint statistically?
- How does the U.S. compare to peer economies under similar measures?

---

### Required Data Types

- Labor productivity indices
- Total factor productivity where available
- Median and average compensation measures
- Wage vs total compensation (including benefits)
- Inflation indices (CPI-U, CPI-U-RS, PCE)
- Cross-national comparisons (limited, contextual)

---

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Explaining *why* decoupling occurred
- Assigning responsibility
- Linking decoupling to household outcomes

---

### Required Outputs

- Definitions table (productivity, compensation, inflation)
- Timeline of divergence under multiple definitions
- Sensitivity notes documenting how results change
- List of rejected measures with reasons
- Open questions and unresolved disagreements

---

## RUN 2: Household Costs and Viability

### Core Research Question

> How did the cost structure of middle-class life change relative to wages?

This run translates macro trends into household-level constraint math without interpretation.

---

### Subquestions

- Which costs shifted from discretionary to fixed?
- How did housing price-to-income ratios change over time?
- How do healthcare costs compare to wage growth?
- How did education and childcare costs evolve?
- How did household vulnerability to income shocks change?
- How did time-use and household slack change?
- How sensitive household viability is to losing one income?

---

### Required Data Types

- Housing prices vs household income
- Rent vs ownership trends
- Healthcare premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs
- Tuition, fees, and student debt
- Childcare costs
- Household budget shares
- Time-use surveys

---

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Blaming dual-income households
- Attributing causality to specific social changes
- Making psychological claims

---

### Required Outputs

- Cost category timelines
- Budget share comparisons across decades
- Single-income vs dual-income stress tests
- Documentation of regional variation
- Areas where data is weak or inconsistent

---

## RUN 3: Distribution and Surplus Capture

### Core Research Question

> Where did economic surplus flow if not to typical workers?

This run documents changes in distribution, not motives or morality.

---

### Subquestions

- How did labor share vs capital share change over time?
- How did income and wealth concentration evolve?
- What happened to CEO compensation ratios?
- How did stock buybacks and dividends change?
- How did union density and bargaining institutions change?
- How did tax and regulatory frameworks shift incentives?

---

### Required Data Types

- National income accounts
- Wealth and income distribution data
- Executive compensation data
- Corporate financial behavior (buybacks, dividends)
- Union membership and coverage
- Tax rate and policy timelines

---

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Proving intent or conspiracy
- Declaring redistribution “theft”
- Arguing inevitability or moral failure

---

### Required Outputs

- Distributional trend summaries
- Institutional change timelines
- Notes on correlation vs causation
- Clear boundaries on what data does not show

---

## Pre–Claim Ledger Deliverables (All Runs)

Before constructing any claim ledger, the following must exist:

- Annotated source inventories per run
- Definitions and measurement choices documented
- Lists of contested or uncertain findings
- Explicit notes on methodological disagreement
- No synthesized conclusions

Only once these exist may claims be drafted.

---

## Completion Criteria

A research run is considered complete when:

- No major sources remain unreviewed
- Measurement choices are explicit
- Uncertainty is documented
- No narrative language remains
- The evidence could survive hostile reading

---

## Prohibited Actions During This Phase

- Writing essays
- Designing infographics
- Using charged language
- Naming villains or heroes
- Drawing policy conclusions
- Collapsing runs into a single document

---

## Transition Rule

> No claim ledger may be created until all three runs meet completion criteria.

This rule is non-negotiable.

---

## End State of This Phase

At the end of the deep research phase, the project should have:

- Three evidence bodies
- Zero narrative commitments
- Maximum optionality for interpretation
- Minimal attack surface

Only then does synthesis begin.
