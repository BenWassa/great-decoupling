# The Great Decoupling

This repository hosts a structured research project examining the growing decoupling between economic indicators, lived experience, institutional performance, and social outcomes in the modern economy.

The project is intentionally built in three layers to support different depths of engagement.

## Three Layers

### 1. Brief
A concise, evidence focused summary designed for fast orientation.  
This layer prioritizes clarity, key findings, and defensible data.

Audience: policymakers, executives, analysts

### 2. Narrative
A long form essay that connects the data into a coherent story.  
This layer emphasizes causality, historical context, and interpretation.

Audience: general readers, educators, writers

### 3. Visual
An interactive infographic experience that makes the core dynamics intuitive.  
This layer emphasizes pattern recognition and exploration.

Audience: broad public, presentations, classrooms

## Deployment

The project is deployed via GitHub Pages using the `/docs` directory.  
All public facing content lives there and can be viewed as a static site.

## Philosophy

- Data first, narrative second, visuals third
- No dashboards without interpretation
- No storytelling without evidence
- Each layer must stand alone while reinforcing the others
